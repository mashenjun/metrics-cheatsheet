# Metrics Cheat Sheet

Collect some common metrics which help to identify performence issue. This Projec is inspired by [Tipedia](https://longfangsong.github.io/tipedia/zh/index.html) 

## Motivation

In my daily work, we use prometheus and grafana for system/process level observability. I found it is hard to understand some speicific metrics and there is no good document elaborating those metrics. So I build this repo to collect helpful infomation which help me to understand the meaning of some metrics.
